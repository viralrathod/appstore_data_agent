       - App Store URL
       - Rating score
       - Number of ratings
       - Pricing (is it free to play, actual price)
       - GameKit/Game Center integration (leaderboards, achievements)
       - Content description (age rating, violence, nudity, etc.)
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive collection of raw data for the identified developer and their top games.
